# Reput

Hi
This is my submission for the trial task given to me by Andrew. I have made this using ReactJS and BootStrap. The user will have to download the sependancies from the react-bootstrap webpage https://react-bootstrap.github.io

The App.js file contains most of the reactjs code. The app.css file includes all the css.
Thankyou
Regards
Ayaan
